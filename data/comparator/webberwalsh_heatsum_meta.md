# Meta for webberwalsh_heatsum.csv

In the 2007/2008 Tree Improvement Program report, Webber and Walsh recorded the amount of heatsum accumulated in the prepollination period and then in the pollination period at Orchard 307 within an experimental irrigation block.

The prepollination period is recorded as "mid April to mid May" and the period of pollination as May 15-31.

The threshold and units of heatsum are not reported. Nor is the source of the temperature data.
