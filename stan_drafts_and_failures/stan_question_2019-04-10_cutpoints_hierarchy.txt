Add effects to difference between cutpoints

I am building an ordered logistic model with three categories. (Trees in phenological states determined by forcing temperatures). I would like to model the difference between cutpoints as a function of the clusters in my data.

I can include the difference between cutpoints, but I can't figure out how to include the clusters in the difference.

Some of the clusters are crossed and others are nested. (It's kind of a messy common garden design). Clones are represented by individual trees, which are male or female. Clones have a provenance. Provenances and clones are both represented at multiple sites.

I'm not actually interested in the cutpoints, I'm interested in the point at which half of the trees have transitioned from one state to another, currently defined in the transformed parameters.

I am new to stan and can't figure out how to add groups to the difference between cutpoints. I am trying to use the difference between cutpoints because I believe that some effects should shift the cutpoints in different directions. I am also open to adding effects to both cutpoints

Here is a working version for simulated data with no groups.

## Simulate data in R and run model
cuts <- c(15,20)
beta <- 0.05
forcing <- unique(phendf$forcing_accum)
eta <- beta * forcing
state <- rordlogit(length(eta), phi = eta, a = cuts)
sim <- data.frame(forcing,state)

K = length(unique(sim$state))
N = nrow(sim)
stan_rdump(c("N", "K", "forcing", "state"), "simulated_nogroups.Rdump")
simplesimdat <- read_rdump("simulated_nogroups.Rdump")

simfit <- stan("cutpoints_difference.stan",
               chains=5, cores=5, iter=2000,
               data=simplesimdat)

## Stan code
data{
    int N; //number of observations
    int K; //number of possible states
    int state[N];
    vector[N] forcing; //predictor
}

parameters{
    positive_ordered[K-1] cutpoints;
    real<lower=0,upper=1> beta; // eta "slope"
    real<lower=0> alpha;
}

transformed parameters {
    //declare params
    vector[K-1] h50; // transition points on forcing scale
    real<lower=0> cdiff; //difference between cutpoints
    //define params
    for ( i in 1:2 ) {
        h50[i] = cutpoints[i]/beta;
    }
    cdiff = cutpoints[2]-cutpoints[1];
}

model{
    //declarations
    vector[N] eta;
    //priors
        //for eta
    beta ~ beta( 0.5 , 5 );
        //for cutpoints
    cutpoints[1] ~ exponential(0.3); // don't let first cutpoint flop around
    alpha ~ lognormal(1,1);
    cdiff ~ gamma(alpha, 1); // difference between first and second cutpoint
    //model
    for ( i in 1:N ) {
        eta[i] = beta * forcing[i];
    }
        state ~ ordered_logistic( eta , cutpoints );
}


I also tried to include effects on each cutpoint individually based on this question https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/stan-users/sgX2Edo8qiQ/Da2g_47OBwAJ. However I couldn't figure out how to include multiple clusters.
