## hmm

Hidden Markov Model attempt. (Related to Clark CDM)

## threshold_tests

Trying to build a stan model that can estimate the threshold temperature as a parameter. But I don't think I can!

## Weibull for truncation
An attempt to use the method described in Roberts & Solow to transform survey data into event data - accouting for truncation. Didn't work for retrospectively obvious reasons described in `.html` file in this folder
