*This document is a writing exercise. I took the paper "The Extent of South-North Pollen Transfer in Finnish Scots Pine" by Varis et al. 2019 and rewrote it, sentence by sentence, to apply to my research.*

# Introduction

Gene flow among populations is belived to be one of the key elements in adaptation of forest tree species to climate change. Garcia and Kirkpatrick showed how models in which genes flowed from central to peripheral populations prevent local adaptation at the distributional limits. The northern range limit of lodgepole pine (*Pinus contorta* subsp. *latifolia*) is in the Yukon and northern British Columbia and it may be suffering from maladaptation in a harsher environment caused by gene flow from the south. In a warming world, gene flow from southern to northern populations may provide alleles that are (pre)adapted to a future climate.

Climatologists predict that climate change will affect the entire distribution of Scots pine within 100 years. In Canada, future climate models predict an increase in annual mean temperature of about 7 degrees above mid 20th century temperatures by the end of the century and increases will be even higher at the northern extent of the species range. The warmer temperatures predicted for the end of the century are more like those currently to the south.

Adaptation to this kind of rapid change requires, among other things, long distance gene flow mediated by pollen transport. In observation studies, pollen grains of wind pollinated tree species have been reported to rise high above the trees and travel long distances, usually tens of kilometers. The earliest reports are from the Gulf of Bothnia where Hesselman (1919) observed pollen of spruce, pine and birch even 55 km from the coast. Recent aerobiological studies have shown that pollen grains can rise to over a kilometer in altitude and travel over 1000km per day. During the preproductive period of lodgepole pine, air masses from the south may bring pollen grains from areas where pollen shed has already begun.

Pollen grain germability after long distance transport is of critical importance to gene flow. The mean germination percentage of lodgepole pine pollen after 24 hours is 50% [@Bohrerova2009].
