> , here’s a large number of files, my recollection of what they do.  At the moment I don’t time to work back through this, 5 years since I looked it:


## runPhenol30.r - appears to be the wrapper code, might be able to just execute this
## bbModel.RData - data
## bbFunctions.r - functions
## functionLibrary.r - more functions
## phenGibbs.r - the Gibbs sampler

there could be other files I’ve overlooked, if so, I probably have them
